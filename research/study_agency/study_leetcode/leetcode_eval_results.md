# Agency Study: Leetcode Hard Evaluation Results (Python)

In this evaluation, various programming agents, including OpenAI's GPT models and various agentic approaches are used to solve Leetcode Hard problems in Python. The results are presented in this document.

## Results

The following results showcase the scores obtained by different agents in the Python programming language using vanilla approaches.

### GPT-3.5-0301-turbo

|----------------------------------|---------------|
| Zero-Shot                        | 0.0           |

These results seem significantly worse than those reported by the recent Reflexion paper [1]. This needs further investigation.
